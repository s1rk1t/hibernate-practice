# hibernate-practice
Collection of sandbox applications used for practicing various hibernate-related actions

These applications are here to demonstrate and reinforce my understanding of hibernate, and the various mappings that exist between hibernate entities. 

Each of the parent folders should adequately describe the relationships therein. 

Note that there is some overlap between projects in terms of the entities that are used to demonstrate the various mappings, and that the code is not designed to demonstrate a mastery of complexity, but rather an understanding of how various entities interact with one another during CRUD based operations used by hibernate in modern Java applications.
